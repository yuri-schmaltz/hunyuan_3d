## **Abstract**

We present Hunyuan3D 2.0, an advanced large-scale 3D synthesis system for generating high-resolution textured 3D assets.
This system includes two foundation components: a large-scale shape generation model - Hunyuan3D-DiT, and a large-scale
texture synthesis model - Hunyuan3D-Paint.
The shape generative model, built on a scalable flow-based diffusion transformer, aims to create geometry that properly
aligns with a given condition image, laying a solid foundation for downstream applications.
The texture synthesis model, benefiting from strong geometric and diffusion priors, produces high-resolution and vibrant
texture maps for either generated or hand-crafted meshes.
Furthermore, we build Hunyuan3D-Studio - a versatile, user-friendly production platform that simplifies the re-creation
process of 3D assets. It allows both professional and amateur users to manipulate or even animate their meshes
efficiently.
We systematically evaluate our models, showing that Hunyuan3D 2.0 outperforms previous state-of-the-art models,
including the open-source models and closed-source models in geometry details, condition alignment, texture quality, and
e.t.c.

## How to run the Archeon Launcher
1) Follow the installation instructions below

2) Enter either one of the commande lines in bash session

To run the Hunyuan3D-2mini (low VRAM) image to 3D generator:
```bash
python launcher.py
```

To run the Hunyuan3D-2mv (multi views) image to 3D generator:
```bash
python launcher.py --mv
```

To run the text to 3D generator (an extension of the mini generator):
```bash
python launcher.py --enable_t23d
```

To run the original Hunyuan3D-2 image to 3D generator:
```bash
python launcher.py --h2
```

## How to run the Archeon API + frontend (split stack)

The `archeon_frontend/` React app talks to the FastAPI backend over HTTP.
Run them as two separate processes:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — backend (defaults: 0.0.0.0:9000 if ARCHEON_API_KEY is set, else 127.0.0.1:9000)
hy3dgen-api --port 9000

# Terminal 2 — frontend dev server (http://localhost:5173)
cd archeon_frontend
cp .env.example .env       # then edit VITE_API_URL if your backend is not on 127.0.0.1:9000
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend reads `VITE_API_URL` (default `http://localhost:9000`) and
appends `/v1` to it. See `archeon_frontend/.env.example` for the full list
of environment variables.

For production:

```bash
# Build a static bundle
cd archeon_frontend && npm run build

# Serve the bundle with any static file server (nginx, Caddy, etc.) and
# point it at the backend. The backend's CORS allow-list is configured
# via the ARCHEON_CORS_ORIGINS env var (comma-separated origins).
```

To run the entire stack in Docker, see `docker-compose.yml` at the project
root:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

To submit a job from the terminal without using the GUI:

```bash
# Text-to-3D, output to chair.glb:
hy3dgen-cli text "a red chair" --output chair.glb

# Image-to-3D with background removal:
hy3dgen-cli image input.png --output model.glb --texture

# Multi-view (4 images, order is front back left right):
hy3dgen-cli multiview front.png back.png left.png right.png --output model.glb

# Re-texture an existing GLB with a reference image:
hy3dgen-cli texture-mesh mesh.glb --image ref.png --output textured.glb
```

To use the Turbo version of one specific model, add *--turbo*. For instance to run the turbo Hunyuan3D-2mv (multi views) image to 3D generator:
```bash
python launcher.py --mv --turbo
```



By default the memory profile assumes 9 GB of VRAM *(profile 3)*. If you have less but at least 6 GB of VRAM add *--profile 4*

To run the image to 3D generator with optimized memory management:
```bash
python launcher.py --profile 3

```
To run the text to 3D generator with optimized memory management:
```bash
python launcher.py --enable_t23d --profile 4

```

You can choose between 5 profiles depending on your hardware:
- HighRAM_HighVRAM  (1) 
- HighRAM_LowVRAM  (2)
- LowRAM_HighVRAM  (3)
- LowRAM_LowVRAM  (4)
- VerylowRAM_LowVRAM  (5) 

Each profile's name describes the targeted level of RAM and VRAM consumptions.\
Usualy the lower the profile number the faster the generation.

## Other GPU Poor Applications

- Wan2GP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Wan2GP :\
Another great 3D Image to Video and Text to Video generator. It can run on very low config as one its models is only 1.5 B parameters

- HuanyuanVideoGP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/HunyuanVideoGP :\
One of the best open source Text to Video generator

- FluxFillGP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/FluxFillGP :\
One of the best inpainting / outpainting tools based on Flux that can run with less than 12 GB of VRAM.

- Cosmos1GP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/Cosmos1GP :\
This application include two models: a text to world generator and a image / video to world (probably the best open source image to video generator).

- OminiControlGP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/OminiControlGP :\
A Flux derived application very powerful that can be used to transfer an object of your choice in a prompted scene. With mmgp you can run it with only 6 GB of VRAM.

- YuE GP: https://github.com/deepbeepmeep/YuEGP :\
A great song generator (instruments + singer's voice) based on prompted Lyrics and a genre description. Thanks to mmgp you can run it with less than 10 GB of VRAM without waiting forever.



### Architecture

Hunyuan3D 2.0 features a two-stage generation pipeline, starting with the creation of a bare mesh, followed by the
synthesis of a texture map for that mesh. This strategy is effective for decoupling the difficulties of shape and
texture generation and also provides flexibility for texturing either generated or handcrafted meshes.

## 🤗 Get Started with Hunyuan3D 2.0

You may follow the next steps to use Hunyuan3D 2.0 via:

- [Code](#code-usage)
- [Archeon Launcher](#archeon-launcher)
- [API Server](#api-server)
- [Blender Addon](#blender-addon)
- [Official Site](#official-site)

### Installation

#### Manual Installation (Recommended)

`pip install -e .` will read `requirements.txt`, install the Python deps, and
build the C++ custom rasterizer (if CUDA is available). For a clean environment,
use a venv or Conda first:

```bash
# 1. Create environment (Python 3.10 recommended)
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install PyTorch (adjust CUDA version if needed)
pip install torch==2.5.1 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/test/cu124

# 3. Install the package (This automatically builds the C++ extensions)
pip install -e .
```

> **Note for Windows Users**: Ensure you have Visual Studio 2022 (with "Desktop development with C++") installed before running the installation, as `cl.exe` is required for compilation.

### Code Usage

We designed a diffusers-like API to use our shape generation model - Hunyuan3D-DiT and texture synthesis model -
Hunyuan3D-Paint.

You could assess **Hunyuan3D-DiT** via:

```python
from hy3dgen.shapegen import Hunyuan3DDiTFlowMatchingPipeline

pipeline = Hunyuan3DDiTFlowMatchingPipeline.from_pretrained('tencent/Hunyuan3D-2')
mesh = pipeline(image='assets/demo.png')[0]
```

The output mesh is a [trimesh object](https://trimesh.org/trimesh.html), which you could save to glb/obj (or other
format) file.

For **Hunyuan3D-Paint**, do the following:

```python
from hy3dgen.texgen import Hunyuan3DPaintPipeline
from hy3dgen.shapegen import Hunyuan3DDiTFlowMatchingPipeline

# let's generate a mesh first
pipeline = Hunyuan3DDiTFlowMatchingPipeline.from_pretrained('tencent/Hunyuan3D-2')
mesh = pipeline(image='assets/demo.png')[0]

pipeline = Hunyuan3DPaintPipeline.from_pretrained('tencent/Hunyuan3D-2')
mesh = pipeline(mesh, image='assets/demo.png')
```

Please visit [examples](examples) folder for more advanced usage, such as **multiview image to 3D generation** and *
*texture generation
for handcrafted mesh**.



### API Server

You could launch an API server locally, which you could post web request for Image/Text to 3D, Texturing existing mesh,
and e.t.c.

```bash
python api_server.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8080
```

A demo post request for image to 3D without texture.

```bash
img_b64_str=$(base64 -i assets/demo.png)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/generate" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "image": "'"$img_b64_str"'",
         }' \
     -o test2.glb
```

### Blender Addon

With an API server launched, you could also directly use Hunyuan3D 2.0 in your blender with
our [Blender Addon](blender_addon.py). Please follow our tutorial to install and use.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8230bfb5-32b1-4e48-91f4-a977c54a4f3e

### Official Site

Don't forget to visit [Hunyuan3D](https://3d.hunyuan.tencent.com) for quick use, if you don't want to host yourself.
