"""API key authentication for the Archeon backend.

When ``ARCHEON_API_KEY`` is set, every request to a protected route must
include a matching ``X-API-Key`` header. When the env var is unset, auth is
disabled and the server is intended to be bound to ``127.0.0.1`` only.

The check is implemented as a FastAPI dependency so routes can opt in
explicitly (``/health`` and ``/v1/system/metrics`` stay open for unauthenticated
monitoring), and tests can override it via ``app.dependency_overrides``.
