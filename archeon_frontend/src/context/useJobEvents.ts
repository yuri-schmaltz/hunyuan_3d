 *
 * Listeners register a callback via ``onJobSubmitted``; the form
 * calls ``notifyJobSubmitted`` after a successful POST.
 *
 * The provider also surfaces the most recent list of SSE events
 * and the connection state so chrome components (header, footer
 * ticker) can render without each subscribing to the stream
