"""Tests for the manager's rehydrate path (round-trip with the store).

Covers:
- A QUEUED job with a stored payload is re-queued and reaches the
  in-memory queue with a reconstructed ``JobRequest``.
- A job without a stored payload is marked FAILED with a helpful
  error instead of silently disappearing.
- A job with a malformed stored payload is also marked FAILED.
