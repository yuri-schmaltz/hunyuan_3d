"""Tests for the manager.py hardening changes in PR #14.

These tests target the four race conditions / shutdown bugs fixed in
PriorityRequestManager without depending on a real torch install
beyond a CPU-only stub.

Coverage:
  - ``_status_transition`` is atomic and refuses stale writes.
  - ``cancel_job`` no-ops cleanly for PROCESSING jobs (was silent fail).
  - ``cancel_job`` refuses to clobber a job that already moved past QUEUED.
  - ``_drain_queue_on_shutdown`` marks every pending job CANCELLED with a
    clear reason.
  - ``_process_queue`` wakes up on shutdown even when no job is queued
    (was: would block forever on stop()).

Implementation note: ``PriorityRequestManager`` is imported lazily inside
the ``_isolation`` fixture so we can stub ``hy3dgen.inference`` (and a
couple of other heavy modules) without polluting ``sys.modules`` for
other test modules pytest imports in the same process. Every test in
this file gets the fixture (autouse=True), and the fixture restores the
real modules after the test completes.
